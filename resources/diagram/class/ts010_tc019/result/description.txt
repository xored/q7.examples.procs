** Nodes / conflict cases **

+ Case: CHANGE coordinates of a Node from one side - DELETE of the same Node from the other side.

+ Result: Conflict between the 2 differences
	- DELETE of the package Node (children delete) -> markers on left and ancestor side + phantom on right side (same location as the ancestor).

	- Coordinates CHANGE of the package Node (coordinates change) -> markers on left and ancestor side only.
